## Overview

This is a basic todo app with added features like theme changing and the ability to reorder tasks on desktop screens, it was built primarilly with html css and javascript

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanila javascript

### What I learned

I Learnt how to implement the dynamic task filter feature using javascript es6 classes for each filter (i.e all, active and completed) the biggest issue I had while building was syncrionising all the filters to appropriately update their respective tasks accurately at all times, admitedly there are still some bugs with the tasks update but for now this is satisfactory enough to show the public.

### Continued development

I would like to continue advancing my general javascript knowledge base particlarly around the subject of making dragable components both on mobile and desktop as the dragable items in this project do not work perfectly enough and I am yet to learn how to use mobile phone touch events to apply them to this scenario
